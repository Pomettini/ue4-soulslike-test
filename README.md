Multiplayer Souls-like made with UE4

Stuff to do:

* Fix backward-right walk animation while targeting
* The targeted enemy player must have a different material (with a Rimlight maybe?)
* ~~Add left, right and back roll~~ (good but not great)
* Add each weapon as an Actor Blueprint
* Weapon picking from the ground (and spawn points)
* The player needs to have a socket on his right hand for the weapon
* And a socket on his left hand for the shield
* Add parry mechanic with the shield (some frames of invulnerability)
* You can parry only if you have a shield attached
* Check weapon-player collision only on server
* Each player needs a health meter on the Gamemode
* Add stamina meter and the gameplay implementation
* Add a HUD for the health and stamina meter
* Add animations for two-handed swords
* Find a way to add different types of animations based on the weapon in use without making a spaghetti monster
* Online matchmaking implementation
* Online matchmaking UI

Low priority:

* Weapon trail
