# ue4-soulslike-test
Multiplayer Souls-like made with UE4

Stuff to do:

* Fix backward-right walk animation while targeting
* The targeted enemy player must have a different material (with a Rimlight maybe?)
* ~~Add left, right and back roll~~ (good but not great)
* Weapon spawn system
* Add parry mechanic with the shield (some frames of invulnerability)
* You can parry only if you have a shield attached
* Check weapon-player collision only on server
* Each player needs a health meter on the Gamemode
* Add stamina meter and the gameplay implementation
* Add a HUD for the health and stamina meter
* Add animations for two-handed swords
* Find a way to add different types of animations based on the weapon in use without making a spaghetti monster
* Online matchmaking implementation
* Online matchmaking UI

Low priority:

* Weapon trail

Bugs:

* Rolling while targeting is currently broken on server
